* As a developer, I want users to sign in with a social media account


## Stretch
* As a developer, have an admin panel to manage games and sign-ups
* As a developer, send e-mail confirmations to those who sign-up
* As a developer, send out e-mail reminders before the game
* As a developer I want to create a wait-list for popular matches
* As a developer I want to integrate with Stripe for CC processing so people can pay for the tickets.
* As a user, I want each match to have their own detail page
