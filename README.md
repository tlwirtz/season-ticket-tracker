# season-ticket-tracker
⚽️ A small app to manage our extra season ticket

## MVP
I should see a list of all Sounders home games
I should be able to click on each home game to see game details
I should be able to see which games are available
If a game is available I should be able to sign-up for it
All data should be saved to a database (firebase)
Have the site protected by authentication (sign-up code / firebase auth)

## Stretch
have an admin panel to manage games and sign-ups
send e-mail confirmations to those who sign-up
send out e-mail reminders before the game
create a wait-list incase someone drops out
