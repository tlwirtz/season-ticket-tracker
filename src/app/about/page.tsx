                <p>
                    All tickets are located in the Southern End of Royal Brougham Park (Lumen Field)
                    in ECS general admission sections 121, 122, 123.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These seats are not for the faint of heart. There will be yelling, drinking,
                    chanting, jumping, and profanity. Your view will be obstructed for portions of
                    the match due to flags, banners and tifo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section expects full participation, so if you are looking for a nice,
                    relaxing experience, this isn&apos;t the section for you. If you&apos;re looking for one
                    of the most authentic and exciting ways to experience American soccer, then step
                    right up.

                <h3 className="soft-grey-text">How Do I Get My Tickets?</h3>
                <p>
                    Once tickets are released, PDFs will be emailed within 24 hours of claiming your
                    match.
                </p>

                <h3 className="soft-grey-text">Payment Options</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, I&apos;m only accepting cash or venmo on or before game day. Since
                    redemption codes are only handed out to trusted friends and family we can
                    coordinate payment methods on a case by case basis.
                </p>

                <h3 className="soft-grey-text">Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    If you need to cancel your ticket, please inform me at least 48 hours before
                    match day. This gives me time to re-list the ticket and find a replacement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don&apos;t panic if you must cancel within 48 hours of match day! Just let me know as
                    soon as you can and we can work together to find a solution.
